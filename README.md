# Tide-Alert
Flooding caused by typhoons in Hong Kong is a severe issue. There is a lack of information, with citizens unaware of flooding until too late to take action against it. Tide Alert aims to change this.

Hong Kong has long faced a serious typhoon issue which continuously worsens due to global warming. Plenty of estates are near seasides and easily become flooded during typhoons as the strong winds cause tides to rise above shorelines. There is a severe lack of real-time information offered to citizens and estates, meaning that often times estates must take extreme action, anticipating the worst. This is costly and often times unecessary. I hope that through my “Tide Alert” system and app that provides real time information of tides, citizens and estates can prepare more effectively against floods. 

Additionally, I have included an AI feature to assist users; using the Hong Kong Observatory's Weather API, I have a page displaying any special warnings (typhoon, e.t.c) and daily weather warnings. My alert system is comprised of stations (ultrasonic sensor, ESP32, and ESP32 camera) that collect data and update my firebase database, and a mobile app made using Thunkable.
